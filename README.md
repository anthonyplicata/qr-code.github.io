## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I really grasped the use of padding on this. I tried this challenge about a week ago and was stuck with the image being attached to the top of the white box. With padding-top I was able to get it off of there without affecting the image. I also played around with adding some shadow because it kind of looked like the reference photo had it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="frame">
  <div class="container">
```
```css
.frame{
    background-color: white;
    height: 500px;
    width: 330px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding-top: 15px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 20px .5px lightslategray;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with syntax. It's slowly but surely coming to me more each day, but it is something I would like to really understand what I am doing without too many peeks at reference guides. But, at a month in, I am happy with what I have gotten so far. Also, I would like to have more organized, cleaner markup.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Always a go to reference for when I am stuck on forgetting what I am supposed to use. I hope to use this less in the future but for now it alleviates a lot of frustration.
